## 🎵 What Makes a Hit?
This project analyses Billboard Hot-100 songs from 2000–2023 to explore how musical features relate to chart success.
### Research Questions
- Which musical features are associated with higher chart rankings?
- How have musical characteristics changed over time?
- Can chart success be predicted using audio features?
### Methods
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in R
- Exploratory data analysis with ggplot2
- Linear regression and Random Forest models
- Model evaluation using RMSE
### Key Findings
- Danceability and loudness are the strongest predictors of chart success
- Popular music has become less acoustic over time
- Musical features alone cannot fully explain chart success
### Code
The full R code and instructions are available in this repository.
